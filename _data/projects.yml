    In this project we used <mark>C++</mark> and <mark>Python</mark> to find ways to better optimize autonomous vehicles networks to avoid vehicle-to-vehicle collision. For more information the paper is included <a href="https://github.com/DavidNaumann/davidnaumann.github.io/blob/master/assets/ResilientCyberPhySys_V2V.pdf">here</a> for you to read.
